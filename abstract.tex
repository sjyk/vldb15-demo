Due to the prevelance of large and dirty databases, there is an increasing commercial and research interest
in scalable data cleaning.
Data cleaning often involves humans, whether expert data scientists or the crowd, and it is often infeasible to clean an entire large database. 
To address this problem, two popular design paradigms have emerged, sample-and-clean and progressive data cleaning. 
In this demonstration, we present our Spark library \projx which abstracts many of the salient features of these data cleaning frameworks into composable primitives.
VLDB attendees will analyze a real dirty dataset of 1000 tagged political comments with duplication and extraction problems.
Our demonstration concludes with the following take-away messages:
(1) It is beneficial to have an integrated data cleaning solution in the analytics stack,
(2) \projx is a general purpose system that implements many of the salient features of sample-and-clean and progressive data cleaning frameworks, and
(3) the API is concise and intuitive to use.
