Data cleaning is challenging due to domain specificity, scalability, and crowd sourcing.
We address these challenges \projx, a Spark library of composable and scalable data cleaning primitives.
\projx abstracts the logical data cleaning operators: Extraction, Similarity Join, Filtering, from the physical implementation i.e, Rule, Crowd, or Machine Learning.
We interface these primitives through a DSL with which a user can build data cleaning operators that suit their needs.
\projx provides transparent optimizations for each of the components and their composition.
The library is available at: \textsf{sampleclean.org}
