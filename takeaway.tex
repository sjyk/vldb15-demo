\section{Conclusion}
In this demonstration, we present a prototype of our \projx system.
Our demonstration concludes with the following take-away messages:
(1) It is beneficial to have an integrated data cleaning solution in the analytics stack,
(2) \projx is a general purpose system that implements many of the salient features of sample-and-clean and progressive data cleaning frameworks, and
(3) the API is concise and intuitive to use.
