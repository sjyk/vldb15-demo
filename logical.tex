\subsection{Logical Operators}
\projx specifies three logical operators: Extraction, Filtering, and Similarity Join. 
\sanjay{In depth why these operators are {\it sufficient}.}

For performance (or some other reason), we support several additional
logical operators tha enable optimization: Sampling, Async, and Transitive Closure.
The composition of these operators support a variety of data cleaning
operations. 
For example, a deduplication task can be expressed as a Similarity Join to pair similar records
together and then a filtering task to remove false positives.
These logical operators specify the input and output data schema and allow us to compose operations.

\noindent \textsf{SimilarityJoin(R,S,$\phi$, $t$)}: For a given relations $R(a_1,...,a_l)$ and $S(b_1,...,b_k)$, a similarity function $\phi$, and a threshold $t$, the similarity join of R and S is defined by:
\[
\{ (r,s) \in R \times S \text{ s.t } \phi (r,s) \ge t \}
\]

\noindent \textsf{Filter(R, $\rho$)}: For a given relation $R(a_1,...,a_l)$ and a boolean condition $\rho$, return $R' \subseteq R$ that satisfies $\rho$.

\noindent \textsf{Extract(R, a, $\epsilon$)} For a given relation $R(a_1,...,a_l)$, a attribute $a$, and an extraction function $\epsilon$, apply $\epsilon$ to every $R(a)$ returning $\epsilon(R(a)) = (v_1,...,v_k)$. The result relation is:
\[
R(a_1,...,a_l,\epsilon(R(a)))
\]

\noindent \textsf{Sample(R, $m$)}: For a given relation $R(a_1,...,a_l)$ and return $R' \subseteq R$ such that each $r \in R$ is in $R'$ with probability $m$.

\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent \textsf{Project(R, $p_1,...,p_k$)}: For a given relation $R(a_1,...,a_l)$ and return $R(p_1,...,p_k)$.

\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent \textsf{TransitiveClosure(R,$f$)}: For a given relation of pairs of rows from the same base relation, e.g the result of a self-Similarity Join, $R(a_1,...,a_l, b_1,...,b_l)$ return the transitive closure of the relation $S(a_1,...,a_l)$. $f$ is called a cannonical representation function, this takes a set of associated records and returns a single record that is designated as the canonical representation.
